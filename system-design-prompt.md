# System Design: AI-Powered Syllabus-to-Calendar Automation App

## Problem Statement
Design a web application that uses computer vision (OpenAI Vision API) to scan academic syllabi (PDF/images) and automatically extract and add events to Google Calendar.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users can authenticate via Google accounts
- Users can upload syllabi as images or PDFs
- System extracts dates, times, event descriptions, and locations from syllabi
- System converts extracted data into formatted calendar events
- Users can review and edit suggested events before committing
- System creates events in the user's Google Calendar
- Users can manage previously created events

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Fast processing time (<30 seconds per syllabus)
- High accuracy in date/time extraction (>90%)
- Secure handling of user credentials and calendar access
- Scalable to handle multiple concurrent users

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components
1. **Frontend Application**
   - Single-page application with responsive design
   - Upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Event review and editing interface
   - Calendar integration and visualization

2. **Backend API Service**
   - Authentication handling
   - File processing and storage
   - Integration with OpenAI Vision API
   - Event formatting and validation
   - Google Calendar API integration

3. **Database**
   - User profiles and preferences
   - Processing history and logs
   - Temporary event storage

4. **External Services**
   - Google OAuth 2.0
   - Google Calendar API
   - OpenAI Vision API
   - Document processing services

### Data Flow
1. User uploads syllabus document
2. Backend processes and stores the document
3. Document is sent to OpenAI Vision API for text extraction
4. Backend parses extracted text to identify potential calendar events
5. Formatted events are presented to user for review
6. Approved events are sent to Google Calendar API
7. Confirmation and results are stored and displayed to user

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js or Next.js
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Material UI or Chakra UI
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **API Communication**: Axios or Fetch API
- **Form Handling**: Formik with Yup validation

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **API Integration**: OpenAI SDK, Google API Client
- **File Processing**: pdf.js, sharp (image processing)
- **NLP Processing**: Custom date/time extraction logic

### Database & Storage
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Caching**: Redis (optional for performance)

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (frontend)
- **Backend Hosting**: Cloud Functions for Firebase
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Firebase Performance Monitoring

## API Design

### User API
- `POST /auth/google` - Google OAuth authentication
- `GET /user/profile` - Get user information
- `PUT /user/preferences` - Update user preferences

### Document API
- `POST /documents/upload` - Upload syllabus document
- `GET /documents/{id}` - Retrieve document status
- `DELETE /documents/{id}` - Delete document

### Event API
- `POST /events/extract` - Extract events from document
- `GET /events/{documentId}` - Get extracted events
- `PUT /events/{id}` - Update event details
- `POST /events/sync` - Sync events to Google Calendar
- `DELETE /events/{id}` - Delete event

## Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0 flow for secure authentication
- Scope-limited API access tokens
- Secure storage of API keys in environment variables
- HTTPS for all communications
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Proper file type validation and scanning

## Scalability Considerations
- Serverless architecture for automatic scaling
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Efficient database indexing for quick queries
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Queue system for processing multiple documents

## Implementation Challenges
- Accurate extraction of dates and times from various syllabus formats
- Handling different academic date formats and nomenclature
- Resolving conflicts with existing calendar events
- Managing Google API rate limits
- Ensuring high accuracy across different document qualities

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Error tracking and reporting
- User engagement metrics
- Processing success rates
- API performance metrics
- Conversion funnels (upload to calendar creation)
